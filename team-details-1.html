				<p class="text-left">
                    Married to Apostle Israel W. Abam, Pastor (Mrs.) Dorcas Abam is blessed with two boys. A woman of great passion, prudence and diligence, Pastor (Mrs.) Abam graduated from the University of Abuja and is co-Senior Pastor with her husband in Guiding Light Assembly, Abuja Worship Centre, Nigeria.

                    As a mother her desires and passion in Ministry are to see the Woman take her place in Christ, and be all that she is created to be, and for couples to succeed as families serving the Lord with great zeal and deep understanding for a better society.  
                    
                    With a streak of tenacity, Pastor (Mrs.) Abam never gives up on anything she gets involved in, be it in Ministry or interpersonal relationships. With her message of Patience in Process, she uses every opportunity to encourage her audience to absolutely depend upon the faithfulness of God, and the need to trust Him who knows what is best for every life, and is through process working out His best in every life. 
                    
                    Deeply sensitive to the needs of those around her, she is an untiring intercessor and prays until something happens in the life of those for whom she intercedes. She is a graceful Counselor with an unusual depth and insight.    
                    
                     A real woman of God with a heart of gold as well as an eye of an eagle, she weaves her motherhood through the intricacies of life to forge a common front for excellence in Ministry.</p>
